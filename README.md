# Project-4-Group-2

## Overview 
This project focuses on the development of machine learning models for real estate applications, including price prediction, recommendation systems, and market analysis. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the objective is to create robust predictive models that can assist home buyers, sellers and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

 - Price Prediction
This supervised learning task aims to understand the relationship between independent variables such as "city," "state," "latitude," "longitude," "price," "bedroom_number," "bathroom_number," "price_per_unit," "living_space," "land_space," "property_type," and the dependent variable, which is the price of the house. The objective is to predict the final price of each home using the following regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest and Lasso Regression.

- Recommendation Systems
The Python script, get_similar_nearby_properties, is specifically designed to identify properties similar to a given reference property based on geographic location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price. Utilizing the Haversine formula, it calculates distances between geographical coordinates to provide recommendations.

- Market Analysis
This part of the project employs unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to identify trends, hotspots, and investment opportunities within the four states in the U.S.: Texas, California, Arizona, and Illinois. These states were selected due to their sizable property datasets.
