# Project-4-Group-2

## Overview 
This project focuses on the development of machine learning models for real estate applications, including price prediction, recommendation systems, and market analysis. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the objective is to create robust predictive models that can assist home buyers, sellers and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

 - Price Prediction
This supervised learning task aims to understand the relationship between independent variables such as "city," "state," "latitude," "longitude," "price," "bedroom_number," "bathroom_number," "price_per_unit," "living_space," "land_space," "property_type," and the dependent variable, which is the price of the house. The objective is to predict the final price of each home using the following regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest and Lasso Regression.

- Recommendation Systems
The Python script, get_similar_nearby_properties, is specifically designed to identify properties similar to a given reference property based on geographic location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price. Utilizing the Haversine formula, it calculates distances between geographical coordinates to provide recommendations.

- Market Analysis
This part of the project employs unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to identify trends, hotspots, and investment opportunities within the four states in the U.S.: Texas, California, Arizona, and Illinois. These states were selected due to their sizable property datasets.

- Visualizing and Analyzing Data
- Link for Tableau Visualization         https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sughra.shadab/vizzes
We used Tableau to create different charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and stories for visualizing and analyzing data to help home buyers in making decisions. we used and compare two data sets and analyse the following questions
1. Relationship between Location and Price
2. Property count and Property Types
3. Minimum and Maximum Price of Property 
4. Features Affecting selling Prices like number of bedrooms and bathrooms, living space, postal code and address
